# DS-TASK-1
### Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis on a dataset provided, focusing on creating a visualization to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.
## Tools And Libraries Used:
### -> jupyter notebook
### -> numpy
### -> pandas
### -> matplotlib and seaborn for visualisation
## DATA ANALYSIS:
### During the data analysis, I have performed data cleaning, data visualisation using bar chart,line chart.
### This project will help in :
  ->Comparative study of population growth rates
  ->Detecting demographic shifts across regions and time periods
  ->Supporting research and policy analysis in demography, economics, and social sciences
## CONCLUSION:
### During the data analysis I have got valuable insights into the distribution of the selected variable in the dataset. This analysis lays the foundation for further exploration and modeling tasks in the data science workflow.
